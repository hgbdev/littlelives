## Description

Design a comprehensive file monitoring service that empowers users to seamlessly upload files to Amazon S3 while enforcing limited quotas per user. This service continuously monitors users' file uploads, verifies their quota usage, and prevents uploads exceeding their allocated quota. Robust authentication and authorization layers are implemented using JWT, Guards, and Middleware to ensure secure operations. Employ `class-validator` for data validation, limiting file size and type.

An admin user with privileged access can adjust user quotas, providing flexibility and control.

Additionally, integrate Swagger API documentation for a user-friendly and interactive API exploration experience. Swagger Documentation URL: http://localhost:3000/swagger
